\section*{Code Of Ethics}
The following code of ethics should be adhered to in any form of hacking, lock picking included.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be SUBTLE — leave no evidence that you were ever there. This is a general rule which applies to lots of circumstances — a few are enumerated explicitly in this list, but many principles follow from this simple edict
    \item Leave things as you found them or better.
    \item Leave no damage.
    \item Do not steal anything.
    \item Brute force is the last resort of the incompetent.
    \item Do not hack while under the influence of alcohol/drugs/etc.
    \item Do not drop things (off a building w/out a ground crew).
    \item Do not hack alone, just like swimming.
    \item Exercise COMMON SENSE. This is another general rule with very wide applicability — when exploring, you are often in places which were not intended for normal traffic. The people who built the area may not have assumed anyone would be there without special knowledge of the area. Many of the assumptions you are used to making are not valid or applicable while hacking. It is very important that you stay alert and think clearly.
\end{itemize}
